This is a toy template that is publicly available, that will enable me to ease into new projects.
I provide this "AS IS". Take it, get started with your project, customize these files to your hearts content.

I don't want to tie this template to a "specific" LICENSE to encourage usage, and allow anyone to use any license they prefer.
